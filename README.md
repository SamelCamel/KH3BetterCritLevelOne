# Kingdom Hearts 3: A Better Critical Level One Playthrough
A .bin file for KH3 that you can import into a save to make your critical level one experience better

# Recommended Playthrough (IMPORTANT)
- Wait to upgrade your Keyblades until the start of the second world group, at that point feel free to upgrade them all to max
- Start the game with Crystal Regalia, then equip your Flanniversary Badges as you gain more Accessory Slots
- You may equip Royal Ribbons as soon as you wish
- The save is balanced with NO FOOD throughout the entire playthrough
- The only abilities you should change are Flowmotion abilities and Berserk Charge
- Feel free to change your teammate's Abilities
- I suggest refraining from using Ultima Weapon unless you get walled by a specific fight

# Requirements
- Kingdom Hearts 3 for PS4
- Save Wizard for PS4 (I suggest using their more recent beta version)
- A computer with stable internet connection

# NOTE
Replacing a save slot with this file will delete that save slot. I am not responsbible for lost data.

This page will walk you through the process of editing your save as best as possible. This guide assumes that you already know how to use Save Wizard at a basic, fundamental level. There are easy guides to follow if you don't know how to do something that I mention. It also assumes you know how to copy your save data to a USB drive from your PS4 (Also very google-able). If you have any questions, DM @SamelCamel_m8 on Twitter and I will try to answer your questions as best as possible!

# Instructions:
1. Open Save Wizard with a USB Drive with your save file on it
2. Right click your save data and open Advanced Mode (Prepare for a possibly long wait)
3. On the hex editor window that pops up, select the save file you want to edit
   - Note: \_\_data\_\_slot\_\_0 is the autosave, which should not be edited if possible, and the rest of the numbered slots correspond to each of their respective numbered saves.
4. Click the rightmost icon in the toolbar on the right (Import File) that looks like a curved arrow
5. Select `KH3 Better Critical Level One by SamelCamel.bin`
6. Select Apply
7. Prepare for another long loading screen, feel free to get some snacks while you wait
8. Once that is done, transfer the newly edited save data back to your PS4
9. Load up KH3 and check if the file was transferred correctly!
