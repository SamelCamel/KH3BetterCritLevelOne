# NOTE
This page will walk you through the process of editing your save as best as possible. This guide assumes that you already know how to use Save Wizard at a basic, fundamental level. There are easy guides to follow if you don't know how to do something that I mention. It also assumes you know how to copy your save data to a USB drive from your PS4 (Also very google-able). If you have any questions, DM @SamelCamel_m8 on Twitter and I will try to answer your questions as best as possible!

# Instructions:
1. Open Save Wizard with a USB Drive with your save file on it
2. Right click your save data and open Advanced Mode (Prepare for a possibly long wait)

4. Click the rightmost icon in the toolbar on the right (Import File) that looks like a curved arrow
5. Select
